This paper propose that the representations of content and style in the CNN are seperable. By utilizing CNN, it can extract style and content information from two seperate image and then combine them together in order to achieve style transfer. This method will extract all content informations including background informations which is not needed in chinese ink style painting. These information may affect the final output. To overcome this problem, we are going to preprocess the input image first in order to remove some of the background information that is not needed.
